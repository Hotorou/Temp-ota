- Added OTA support
- Camera2 is now default camera
- Imported OSS Camera hal
- Make hal switcher titles more user friendly
- Fixed up some stuff

Bugs:
- Encryption doesn't work
- Multi touch misbehaves if 3 finger screenshot enabled
- Status Bar/QS battery percentage might not show up. A workaround is goto turn off and turn on the screen using power button (not reboot)
